Our Project for the Unstructured Information Processing course on Fake News Challenge (http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/)

A machine learning approach to *stance detection*. The problem statement can be found at the [official website introducing the challenge](http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/). Explanations for our wok can be found in `Report.pdf`. This was our end-semester project for Unstructured Information Processing (CS-406) at Ashoka University (in Monsoon 2019).

# How to use
- Use `main.ipynb` to go through the code. This file is well commented and hence self-explanatory. Run only the cells inside a "demo" heading to see predictions.
- `model_ru.h5` and `vectorizer_ru.pickle` are the model and vectorizer for the first sub-task (related-unrelated).
- `model_add.h5` and `vectorizer_add.pickle` are the model and vectorizer for the second sub-task (agree-disagree-discuss).
